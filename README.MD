# CRUD API (Spring Boot)

A simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** REST API built with **Spring Boot** and **Maven**.  
Currently, it uses **hardcoded in-memory data** for demonstration purposes.  
Future versions will include **database integration**.

This is a **basic CRUD API** using hardcoded data. A database-integrated version with additional features will be available soon in a separate repository.
